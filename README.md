- 👋 Hi, I’m @deadPixelsGreta
- 👀 I’m interested in digital planning & consultation processes, which is why I am co-developing zimplify.io. I'm playing around with LLM and a chat with custom files and better knowledge management. I am fascinated by astro in combination with qwik
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Phython, JavaScript and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on perhaps with people who would like to co-develop a chat LLM implementation for a knowledge query about their own documents such as meeting notes and emails.
- 📫 How to reach me 
- 😄 Pronouns: gladly greta
- ⚡ Fun fact: Children know what closed questions are and answer them accurately. Adults lose this knowledge over the years and often answer in lengthy monologues instead of yes/no/ I don't know.
